## Quick Intro 👋
 Hi there, my name is Marthel Rodriguez. 
 
 I have started my coding journey in late 2018 with a coding bootcamp that came from France. Today, I'm studying in Pasadena City College. 🏫
 
 I'm currently focusing on learning web development and UX/UI. Looking forward to become an SWE in the near future.
